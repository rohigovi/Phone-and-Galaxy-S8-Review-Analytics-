# Phone-and-Galaxy-S8-Review-Analytics
Part of the Final Project for Data Science for Product Managers(95-851) taught at Carnegie Mellon

Analyzed sentiments for over 1 million tweets/posts for Galaxy S8 and iPhone X, used Latent Dirichlet Allocation(topic 
modelling) to identify most popular features of both phones and developed a random forest algorithm to predict future 
rate of adoption of the two products

The Main Data Science Techniques Covered are:
Topic Modelling(Latent Dirichlet Algorithm) + NLP Sentiment Analysis(Vader) + Supervised Learning(Random Forest Classification)
